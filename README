libmove3d-hri groups several tools for human-robot interaction:

- A generalized inverse kinematics library,
- Visiblity functions used to computed visible places and objects from 
  different point of view,
- The SPAtial Reasoning and Knowledge library that computes symbolic
  models of the environment,
- The MightabilityMaps library that computes possible location for
  actions ("where could I hand a bottle to a human?")
